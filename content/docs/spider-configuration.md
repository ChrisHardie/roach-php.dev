## Introduction

Spider classes can contain quite a bit of configuration. Everything from what the starting URLs are, to which [downloader middleware](/docs/downloader-middleware) to use and which [extensions](/docs/extensions) to activate. This allows us to fully control the behavior of almost every part of Roach when running our spider.

This page looks at all the different things we can configure for our spider as well as different strategies to load that configuration.
